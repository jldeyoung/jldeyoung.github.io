## Abstract

Corner rectangle visibility graphs (CRVGs) combine two existing lines of inquiry in graph theory: rectangle visibility graphs (RVGs) and rectangle-of-influence graphs (RIGs). An RVG uses vertical and horizontal bands of sight between axis-parallel rectangles in the plane to construct a graph whose vertices and edges correspond to rectangles and visibility bands respectively. RIGs are a straight-line embedding of a graph, where edges can be represented as empty axis-parallel rectangles of influence with adjacent vertices at opposing corners of the RI.
We define CRVGs by giving each rectangle a single eye in its corner and defining visibility relations accordingly. We prove that families of graphs, including paths, cycles, wheels, trees, \\(k\\)-partite graphs up to \\(k=4\\), and complete graphs \\(K_n\\) for \\(n \\leq 5\\) are representable by corner rectangle diagrams.
Our work further analyzes the maximum number of edges \\(e\\) that can be drawn in restricted CRVG representations: (1) where all rectangles look the same direction (SCRVGs), \\(e=\\left[\\frac{n^2}{4}\\right]+n-2\\); and (2) where all rectangles look in orthogonal directions (SWCRVGs), \\(e=\\left[\\frac{n^2}{3}+\\frac{n}{3}\\right]-1\\).

## Presentation

We gave an oral presentation of this research at Willamette University's 
[Student Scholarship Recognition Day](https://willamette.edu/arts-sciences/additional-academic-opportunities/ssrd/schedule-2023/room10.html) 
and at a Willamette University [Mathematics Colloquium](https://willamette.edu/undergraduate/math/news/colloquia/index.html).
